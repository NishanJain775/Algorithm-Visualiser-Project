# Algorithm-Visualiser [[link]](https://nishanjain775.github.io/Algorithm-Visualiser-Project/)

I am thrilled to present my personal web development project, the Algorithm Visualizer. This project serves as a platform where I showcase various searching, sorting, and tree traversal techniques in an interactive and visually appealing manner.

Through this project, I aim to bridge the gap between theoretical algorithms and practical implementation. By providing a visual representation of these algorithms, users can gain a deeper understanding of how they work and witness their efficiency in action.

The Algorithm Visualizer features a user-friendly interface that allows users to select from a wide range of algorithms. Whether it's binary search, bubble sort, tree traversal techniques, or any other algorithm, users can experience their step-by-step execution and observe how they manipulate data structures.

I have put significant effort into designing an intuitive and visually captivating experience. The user interface is carefully crafted to provide a seamless interaction, ensuring that users can focus on grasping the intricacies of the algorithms without any distractions.

With this project, I aim to contribute to the learning and exploration of algorithms by making them accessible and engaging. Whether you are a student, a developer, or simply an algorithm enthusiast, the Algorithm Visualizer offers a unique opportunity to enhance your understanding of these fundamental concepts.
